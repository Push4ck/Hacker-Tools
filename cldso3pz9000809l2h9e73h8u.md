# Roaming Mantis: The Android Banking Malware Hijacking Routers and Stealing Sensitive Information

In this digital age, we all rely heavily on our internet routers to keep us connected. But what happens when these same routers become how cybercriminals steal our sensitive information? That's exactly what's happening with the new malware [**campaign**](https://securelist.com/roaming-mantis-uses-dns-hijacking-to-infect-android-smartphones/85178/) known as "Roaming Mantis".

Security researchers have been sounding the alarm about this ongoing threat that is hijacking internet routers to distribute malicious Android banking malware. The malware tricks victims into installing it by hijacking the DNS settings of vulnerable and poorly secured routers. This allows hackers to intercept traffic, inject rogue ads on web pages, and redirect users to phishing pages designed to steal sensitive information like login credentials, bank account details, and even the secret code for two-factor authentication.

The Roaming Mantis malware primarily targets users in Asian countries such as South Korea, China, Bangladesh, and Japan. The rogue DNS settings configured by hackers redirect victims to fake versions of legitimate websites, where they are prompted to download a "Chrome browser app for Android". In reality, the app is the Roaming Mantis malware that takes control of the device, allowing hackers to steal the secret verification code for two-factor authentication.

To ensure that your personal and financial information is safe, it is important to ensure that your router is running the latest version of the firmware and protected with a strong password. Additionally, it is recommended to disable the router's remote administration feature and hardcode a trusted DNS server into the operating system network settings. Stay vigilant and protect your data from cyber threats like Roaming Mantis.

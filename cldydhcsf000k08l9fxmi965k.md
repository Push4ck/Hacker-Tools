# Reddit Reveals: A Sophisticated Phishing Attack Breaches Internal Systems

In a recent announcement, the popular social news aggregation platform, Reddit, reported a security incident that resulted in unauthorized access to its internal documents, code, and some of its business systems. The cause of this breach was identified as a "sophisticated and highly-targeted phishing attack."

On February 5, 2023, Reddit became a target of this malicious phishing scheme. The attackers sent out plausible-looking prompts that redirected employees to a fake website masquerading as Reddit's intranet portal. The objective of this attack was to steal the employees' credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens. Sadly, the phishing attack was successful, and a single employee's credentials were obtained, granting the attacker access to Reddit's internal systems.

However, Reddit has reassured its users that there is no evidence to suggest that its production systems have been breached or that any user's non-public data has been compromised. Additionally, the company has reported that there is no indication that the accessed information has been published or distributed online.

Although the exposure included limited contact information for current and former employees and company contacts, as well as some advertiser information, Reddit has emphasized that similar phishing attacks have been [**reported**](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/10y427y/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_we_know/) in the recent past. The company did not disclose the source code that was accessed following this security incident.

This latest breach serves as a reminder of the ever-evolving tactics used by threat actors to defeat 2FA measures. It also highlights the need for companies to remain vigilant in their efforts to protect sensitive information and prevent security incidents.

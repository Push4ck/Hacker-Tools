# The Fastest and Most Secure DNS Service: Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1

The internet has become an integral part of our lives, providing us with a wealth of information and opportunities. However, as we spend more time online, we expose ourselves to various risks, including cyber attacks, identity theft, and data breaches. To combat these threats, we need to protect our online privacy, and one way to do this is by using a secure and fast Domain Name System (DNS) resolver.

Recently, Cloudflare, a well-known Internet performance and security company, launched [**1.1.1.1**](https://1.1.1.1/), the world's fastest and most privacy-focused secure DNS service. The DNS resolver is responsible for matching human-readable web addresses (e.g., [**cyberhub.hashnode.dev**](https://cyberhub.hashnode.dev/)) with their actual location on the internet, which is known as IP addresses. The default DNS services provided by ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are often slow and insecure, which is why many people use alternative DNS providers, such as OpenDNS and Google, to speed up their internet connection.

However, [**Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS service**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/) takes things to a whole new level. According to Cloudflare, this service resolves domain names within 14.8 milliseconds, which is over 28% faster than its competitors, like OpenDNS and Google. Furthermore, it offers a higher level of privacy, making it more difficult for ISPs to track your web history. When you use the default DNS services provided by ISPs, they log every site you visit, even if you're using HTTPS. Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS service, on the other hand, supports both [**DNS-over-TLS**](https://cyberhub.hashnode.dev/protect-your-online-privacy-with-dns-over-tls-the-future-of-secure-internet-browsing) and DNS-over-HTTPS to ensure maximum privacy and prevent ISPs from easily tracking your web browsing history.

Another important aspect of Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS service is that the company has promised not to sell users' data. Instead, it wipes all logs of DNS queries within 24 hours. To further prove its commitment to privacy, Cloudflare is working with auditors at KPMG to examine its systems and guarantee that it's not collecting user data.

# Examining the Flaws in the Digital Certificate Management System and the Rise of Certificate Transparency

The internet is home to various encryption technologies that safeguard the privacy and integrity of personal data for billions of users. One such system is the Digital Certificate Management System (DCMS), which is the weakest link in internet security, as it operates solely based on trust. The DCMS is prone to breaches and has been compromised several times in the past.

To understand the issues with the current DCMS, one must understand the role of Certificate Authorities (CA), who acts as a central trusted body responsible for issuing and validating digital SSL/TLS certificates. However, the power of CAs to issue certificates for any domain can easily be abused or misused, leading to fraudulent certificates and putting internet users' privacy at risk.

One such example is the Symantec incident in which Google discovered that the CA had improperly issued a duplicate certificate for [google.com](http://google.com) to someone else. Additionally, the man-in-the-middle attack that resulted from the chain of trust is broken has been amplified by the revelations made by Edward Snowden regarding the NSA's interception and cracking of massive numbers of HTTPS-encrypted web sessions.

Furthermore, governments have been known to abuse trusted CAs for malicious purposes, such as the incident involving the DigiNotar CA and the Gmail accounts of Iranian users. These examples serve as a wake-up call to internet users, who can no longer blindly trust CAs to issue digital certificates.

To solve these issues, the Certificate Transparency (CT) system has been introduced as a public service that allows individuals and companies to monitor the digital security certificates issued for their domains. The CT framework includes certificate logs, monitors, and auditors, and requires CAs to publicly declare every digital certificate they have generated. The certificate [**logs**](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-community-site/blob/master/docs/google/known-logs.md) offer users a way to look up all certificates issued for a given domain name and are cryptographically assured, append-only, and publicly auditable.

The CT system makes the process of detecting rogue certificates much easier and offers the ability to quickly identify certificates that have been issued mistakenly or maliciously, helping to mitigate security concerns. An example of this is the Facebook security team's early detection of duplicate SSL certificates issued for multiple [**fb.com**](https://www.facebook.com/) subdomains.

In conclusion, the Digital Certificate Management System has flaws that have been repeatedly exploited, leading to significant security concerns. The rise of Certificate Transparency offers a solution to these problems and helps ensure the privacy and integrity of personal data on the internet.

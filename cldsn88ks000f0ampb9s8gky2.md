# Facebook Implements Certificate Transparency Monitoring Tool to Protect Online Privacy

Digital certificates serve as the foundation for secure internet communication, protecting sensitive information, and authenticating systems and users. Online privacy heavily relies on SSL/TLS certificates and encryption keys to secure websites and applications. However, the current certificate management system and trusted certificate authorities (CAs) are not enough to prevent the misuse of SSL certificates on the internet.

To address the trust issues with CAs, Google launched the Certificate Transparency project in 2013, allowing anyone to easily detect fraudulent and stolen certificates. Facebook has now implemented its own Certificate Transparency Monitoring Tool to efficiently manage its digital certificates and quickly respond to potential threats.

Facebook's Certificate Transparency Monitoring Tool continuously scans public certificate transparency logs for any new certificates issued for the root domains and subdomains of **facebook.com** and **fb.com**. Although the tool does not come with an in-built monitoring and alert service, Facebook security was able to quickly detect [**fraudulent certificates**](https://www.facebook.com/notes/2512012032429988/) with the help of its experimental monitoring tool. The tool provides information necessary to revoke rogue certificates, although the process still requires contacting the issuing CA or browser vendors.

Facebook's Certificate Transparency Monitoring Service will soon be available to everyone for free in the coming months. The Certificate Transparency project aims to address flaws in the SSL certificate system by introducing an extra layer of verification, requiring web servers to prove that a certificate is registered with a CT log before it can be trusted.

Despite Google's efforts to push for the adoption of Certificate Transparency, its implementation is still in its early stages. Currently, Google's Root Certificate Policy requires extended validation certificates to be logged into CT, but domain validation certificates can still be issued without being logged into CT. Chrome is working on a short-term solution to increase the adoption of Certificate Transparency.

# GuLoader: The Advanced Malware Downloader's Stealth Tactics Uncovered

Cybersecurity is a growing concern in today's world as the internet becomes increasingly indispensable to our daily lives. With the rise of cybercrime, security experts must stay ahead of the game by detecting and analyzing new threats as they emerge. In this article, we will be discussing the latest findings from cybersecurity researchers on an advanced malware downloader called GuLoader, also known as [**CloudEyE**](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.cloudeye).

GuLoader is a Visual Basic Script (VBS) downloader that's used to distribute remote access trojans, such as [**Remcos**](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.remcos), to infected machines. It was first detected in the wild in 2019 and has been evolving ever since. In November 2021, a new strain of JavaScript malware, RATDispenser, [**emerged**](https://cyberhub.hashnode.dev/new-malware-strain-ratdispenser-a-threat-to-your-sensitive-data) as a conduit for dropping GuLoader using a Base64-encoded VBScript dropper.

Recent GuLoader samples analyzed by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike have revealed a three-stage process in which the VBScript delivers a next stage that performs anti-analysis checks before injecting shellcode embedded within the VBScript into memory. The shellcode, which employs several anti-analysis and anti-debugging tricks, downloads a final payload of the attacker's choice from a remote server and executes it on the compromised host.

One of the standout features of GuLoader's shellcode is its ability to scan for virtualization software, as well as anti-debugging and anti-disassembling checks to detect the presence of remote debuggers and [**breakpoints**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint). If any are found, the shellcode will terminate. Additionally, GuLoader features a "redundant code injection mechanism" to avoid [**NTDLL.dll**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/libraries-and-headers) hooks implemented by endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. NTDLL.dll API [**hooking**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/about-hooks) is a [**technique**](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/08/firewalker-a-new-approach-to-generically-bypass-user-space-edr-hooking/) [**used**](https://cymulate.com/blog/extracting-syscalls-from-a-suspended-process/) by anti-malware engines to detect and flag suspicious processes on Windows by monitoring APIs that are known to be abused by threat actors.

CrowdStrike's [**findings**](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/guloader-dissection-reveals-new-anti-analysis-techniques-and-code-injection-redundancy/) come at a time when another cybersecurity firm, Cymulate, demonstrated an EDR bypass technique known as [**Blindside**](https://cymulate.com/blog/blindside-a-new-technique-for-edr-evasion-with-hardware-breakpoints) that allows for running arbitrary code by using hardware breakpoints to create a "process with only the NTDLL in a stand-alone, unhooked state."

In a nutshell, the method involves using assembly instructions to invoke the necessary windows API function to allocate memory (i.e., [**NtAllocateVirtualMemory**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-ntallocatevirtualmemory)) and inject arbitrary shellcode into that location via [**process hollowing**](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/).

In conclusion, GuLoader remains a dangerous threat that's constantly evolving with new methods to evade detection. Cybersecurity researchers must stay ahead of the game by analyzing these threats and finding ways to protect against them. Organizations and individuals need to be proactive about cybersecurity and implement measures to prevent attacks and protect their data. With the rise of cybercrime, cybersecurity should be a top priority for everyone.

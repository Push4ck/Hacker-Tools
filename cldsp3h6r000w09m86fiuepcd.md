# Roaming Mantis: The Upgraded Malware Hijacking Routers and Stealing Sensitive Information

The widespread router DNS hijacking malware, [**Roaming Mantis**](https://cyberhub.hashnode.dev/roaming-mantis-the-android-banking-malware-hijacking-routers-and-stealing-sensitive-information), has taken a step forward in its malicious activities by upgrading its capabilities to target both iOS and desktop devices. Previously, Roaming Mantis was only targeting Android devices, but according to security researchers at [**Kaspersky Lab**](https://securelist.com/roaming-mantis-dabbles-in-mining-and-phishing-multilingually/85607/) now the criminal group behind this malware, the campaign has broadened its horizons by adding phishing attacks for iOS users and cryptocurrency mining scripts for desktop users.

This malware operates by changing the DNS settings of the wireless routers and redirecting traffic to malicious websites controlled by the attackers. Once installed, the malware infects Android devices with banking malware, phishing sites for iOS users, and crypto-mining scripts for desktop users. The malware is rapidly growing, and security researchers believe that the group behind it is well-funded and motivated by financial gain.

To protect yourself from Roaming Mantis, ensure your router is up-to-date and protected with a strong password. Avoid visiting websites without HTTPS enabled, disable the remote administration feature on your router, and hardcode a trusted DNS server into your network settings. On Android devices, only install apps from official stores and disable the installation of apps from unknown sources. To check if your Wi-Fi router is compromised, review your DNS settings and change the DNS server address if necessary. Change all your account passwords immediately.
